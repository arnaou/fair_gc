## About

<table><tr><td>
In every ML-based property prediction paper, classical Group-contribution (GC) models
have been a constant target for scrutiny due to the workflow associated with their development.
A main point that is constantly highlighted is the fact that their ability to extrapolate
remains untested considering that all available data were used for model calibration, leaving none for validation.
While some have advocated that this approach is not necessarily wrong since classical GC models are parametric
and thus the risk of overfitting is small, their ability to extrapolate to data beyond the training set is still
not verified. 

In this work, we develop a framework for fair development and comparison of GC-based ML
models for a wide range of properties.
